# Web & =) 
[globe.davekwiatkowski.com](globe.davekwiatkowski.com) | Capital One Global Data Visualization 
### What I built
* I created an interactive web application to analyze the relationship between web usage and life satisfaction
* I also enabled the user to evaluate 3 different data sets to see how they compare to one another
* The user can use the [WebGL Globe](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) in my application to get a bigger picture of how areas in the world line up to each other in my these 3 different data sets from multiple sources
* I also took this project as an opportunity to practice my web development skills and make my own discoveries - relating to the product and the process

### What I used
* This project is composed of 68.3% JavaScript, 19.2% CSS, and 12.5% HTML
* I used an SVG for the loading animation and used [FakeSmile](https://leunen.me/fakesmile/) to enable cross-platform animations
* I created JSON data for parsing as both files and arrays
* In to using CSS3 to make animations, I also used some jQuery
* In addition to the [WebGL Globe API](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe), I used the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) for a diverse set of data visualization
* I used SCSS for CSS preprocessing in order to modularize and speed up the project
* I used gulp.js as well for an efficient build process
